\section{Introduction}
Sudoku is a numerical puzzle game. The idea is to solve an $n\times n$ grid filled with numbers, this grid usually consists of square blocks with 3 rows and 3 columns. These individual blocks are then arranged in a similar manner again, with 3 blocks along rows and 3 along columns, producing a $9 \times 9$ matrix. We need to fill the blocks with one of these numbers ${1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}$. The rules for filling these blocks are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item[•] Within each block we can only have single occurrence of a number.
\item[•] Along a each row we can only have single occurrence of a number.
\item[•] Along a each column we can only have a single occurrence of a number.
\end{itemize}
